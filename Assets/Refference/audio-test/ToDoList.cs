 * 
 * Adapt audiospectrum tool to "measure" target spectrum of birdcalls
 * Finalize audiospectrum tool to measure accuracy of user whistles
 * 	- Create "easy mode" that measures octaves down
 * 	- Implement accuracy adjusters to make some birds more or less difficult to catch
 * 	- Implement user-adjustable volume threshold tool.
